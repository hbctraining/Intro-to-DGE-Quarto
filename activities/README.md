## In-class polls

This is a space to keep all answer keys for zoom/Google polls used in class. These poll questions do not currently exist for all workshops, and are not always in-use. These questions are helpful for assessments.

New markdowns can be created in this directory using the naming `day1_polls.md` etc. Please use headers to separate questions by topic, as they are organized similarly on Zoom/Google forms.
