    "text": "1. RNA extraction and library preparation\nBefore RNA can be sequenced, it must first be extracted and separated from its cellular environment and prepared into a cDNA library. There are a number of steps involved which are outlined in the figure below, and in parallel there are various quality checks implemented to make sure we have good quality RNA to move forward with. We briefly describe some of these steps below.\na. Enriching for RNA. Once the sample has been treated with DNAse to remove any contaminating DNA sequence, the sample undergoes either selection of the mRNA (polyA selection) or depletion of the rRNA.\nGenerally, ribosomal RNA represents the majority of the RNAs present in a cell, while messenger RNAs represent a small percentage of total RNA (~2% in humans). Therefore, if we want to study the protein-coding genes, we need to enrich for mRNA or deplete the rRNA. For differential gene expression analysis, it is best to enrich for Poly(A)+, unless you are aiming to obtain information about long non-coding RNAs, in which case ribosomal RNA depletion is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRNA Quality check\n\n\n\nIt is essential to check for the integrity of the extracted RNA prior to starting the cDNA library prepation. Traditionally, RNA integrity was assessed via gel electrophoresis by visual inspection of the ribosomal RNA bands, but that method is time-consuming and imprecise. The Bioanalyzer system from Agilent will rapidly assess RNA integrity and calculate an RNA Integrity Number (RIN), which facilitates the interpretation and reproducibility of RNA quality. RIN, essentially, provides a means by which RNA quality from different samples can be compared to each other in a standardized manner.\n\n\nb. Fragmentation and size selection. The remaining RNA molecules are then fragmented. This is done either via chemical, enzymatic (e.g., RNAses), or physical processes (e.g., chemical/mechanical shearing). These fragments then undergo size selection to retain only those fragments within a size range that Illumina sequencing machines can handle best, i.e., between 150 to 300 bp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFragment size quality check\n\n\n\nAfter size selection/exclusion, the fragment size distribution should be assesed to ensure that it is unimodal and well-defined.\n\n\nc. Reverse transcribe RNA into double-stranded cDNA. Information about which strand a fragment originated from can be preserved by creating stranded libraries. The most commonly used method incorporates deoxy-UTP during the synthesis of the second cDNA strand (Levin JZ et al., 2010). Once double-stranded cDNA fragments are generated, sequence adapters are ligated to the ends. (Size selection can be performed here instead of at the RNA level.)\nd. PCR amplification. If the amount of starting material is low and/or to increase the number of cDNA molecules to an amount sufficient for sequencing, libraries are usually PCR amplified. Run as few amplification cycles as possible to avoid PCR artefacts.\n\n\n\nImage source: Zeng W and Mortazavi A, 2012",

    "text": "2. Sequencing (Illumina)\nSequencing of the cDNA libraries will generate reads. Reads correspond to the nucleotide sequences of the ends of each of the cDNA fragements in the library. You will have the choice of sequencing either a single end of the cDNA fragments (single-end reads) or both ends of the fragments (paired-end reads).\n\n\n\n\nSE - Single end dataset =&gt; Only Read1\nPE - Paired-end dataset =&gt; Read1 + Read2\n\ncan be 2 separate FastQ files or just one with interleaved pairs\n\n\nGenerally single-end sequencing is sufficient unless it is expected that the reads will match multiple locations on the genome (e.g. organisms with many paralogous genes), assemblies are being performed, or for splice isoform differentiation. Be aware that paired-end reads are generally 2x more expensive.\n\nSequencing-by-synthesis\nIllumina sequencing technology uses a sequencing-by-synthesis approach. To explore sequencing by synthesis in more depth, please watch this linked video on Illumina’s YouTube channel.\nWe have privided a brief explanation of the steps below:\nCluster growth: The DNA fragments in the cDNA library are denatured and hybridized to the glass flowcell (adapter complementarity). Each fragment is then clonally amplified, forming a cluster of double-stranded DNA. This step is necessary to ensure that the sequencing signal will be strong enough to be detected/captured unambiguously for each base of each fragment.\n\nNumber of clusters ~= Number of reads\n\nSequencing: The sequencing of the fragment ends is based on fluorophore-labelled dNTPs with reversible terminator elements. In each sequencing cycle, a base is incorporated into every cluster and excited by a laser.\nImage acquisition: Each dNTP has a distinct excitatory signal emission that is captured by cameras.\nBase calling: The Base calling program will then generate the sequence of bases, i.e. reads, for each fragement/cluster by assessing the images captured during the many sequencing cycles. In addition to calling the base in every position, the base caller will also report the certainty with which it was able to make the call (quality information).\n\nNumber of sequencing cycles = Length of reads",

In comparison to these tools, the lightweight alignment tools not only provide quantification estimates faster (typically more than 20 times faster), but also prove improvements in accuracy (Robert C and Watson M, 2015).\nWe will use the expression estimates, often referred to as ‘pseudocounts’, obtained from Salmon as the starting point for the differential gene expression analysis.",

MultiQC is a tool that aggregates results from several tools and generates a single HTML report with plots to visualize and compare various QC metrics between the samples. Assessment of the QC metrics may result in the removal of samples before proceeding to the next step, if necessary.\n\nOnce the QC has been performed on all the samples, we are ready to get started with Differential Gene Expression analysis with DESeq2!",

    "section": "Replicates",
    "text": "Replicates\nExperimental replicates can be performed as technical replicates or biological replicates.\n\nImage credit: Klaus B, 2015\n\nTechnical replicates: use the same biological sample to repeat the technical or experimental steps in order to accurately measure technical variation and remove it during analysis.\nBiological replicates use different biological samples of the same condition to measure the biological variation between samples.\n\nIn the days of microarrays, technical replicates were considered a necessity; however, with the current RNA-seq technologies, technical variation is much lower than biological variation and technical replicates are unneccessary.\nIn contrast, biological replicates are absolutely essential for differential expression analysis. For mice or rats, this might be easy to determine what constitutes a different biological sample, but it’s a bit more difficult to determine for cell lines. This article gives some great recommendations for cell line replicates.\nFor differential expression analysis, the more biological replicates, the better the estimates of biological variation and the more precise our estimates of the mean expression levels. This leads to more accurate modeling of our data and identification of more differentially expressed genes.\n\nImage credit: Liu Y et al., 2014\nAs the figure above illustrates, biological replicates are of greater importance than sequencing depth, which is the total number of reads sequenced per sample. The figure shows the relationship between sequencing depth and number of replicates on the number of differentially expressed genes identified [1]. Note that an increase in the number of replicates tends to return more DE genes than increasing the sequencing depth. Therefore, generally more replicates are better than higher sequencing depth, with the caveat that higher depth is required for detection of lowly expressed DE genes and for performing isoform-level differential expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample pooling\n\n\n\nTry to avoid pooling of individuals/experiments, if possible; however, if absolutely necessary, then each pooled set of samples would count as a single replicate. To ensure similar amounts of variation between replicates, you would want to pool the same number of individuals for each pooled set of samples.\nFor example, if you need at least 3 individuals to get enough material for your control replicate and at least 5 individuals to get enough material for your treatment replicate, you would pool 5 individuals for the control and 5 individuals for the treatment condition. You would also make sure that the individuals that are pooled in both conditions are similar in sex, age, etc.\n\n\nReplicates are almost always preferred to greater sequencing depth for bulk RNA-seq. However, guidelines depend on the experiment performed and the desired analysis. Below we list some general guidelines for replicates and sequencing depth to help with experimental planning:\n\nGeneral gene-level differential expression:\n\nENCODE guidelines suggest 30 million SE reads per sample (stranded).\n15 million reads per sample is often sufficient, if there are a good number of replicates (&gt;3).\nSpend money on more biological replicates, if possible.\nGenerally recommended to have read length &gt;= 50 bp.\n\nGene-level differential expression with detection of lowly-expressed genes:\n\nSimilarly benefits from replicates more than sequencing depth.\nSequence deeper with at least 30-60 million reads depending on level of expression (start with 30 million with a good number of replicates).\nGenerally recommended to have read length &gt;= 50 bp.\n\nIsoform-level differential expression:\n\nFor known isoforms, suggested to have a depth of at least 30 million reads per sample and paired-end reads.\nFor novel isoforms, should have more depth (&gt; 60 million reads per sample).\nChoose biological replicates over paired/deeper sequencing.\nGenerally recommended to have read length &gt;= 50 bp, but longer is better as the reads will be more likely to cross exon junctions.\nPerform careful QC of RNA quality. Be careful to use high quality preparation methods and restrict analysis to high quality RIN # samples.\n\nOther types of RNA analyses (intron retention, small RNA-Seq, etc.):\n\nDifferent recommendations depending on the analysis.\nAlmost always more biological replicates are better!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe factor used to estimate the depth of sequencing for genomes is “coverage” - how many times do the number of nucleotides sequenced “cover” the genome. This metric is not exact for genomes (whole genome sequencing), but it is good enough and is used extensively. However, the metric does not work for transcriptomes because even though you may know what % of the genome has transcriptional activity, the expression of the genes is highly variable.",
