> **NOTE:** To run through the code above, you will need to be **logged into O2** and **working on a compute node** (i.e. your command prompt should have the word `compute` in it).
> 1. Log in using `ssh rc_trainingXX@o2.hms.harvard.edu` and enter your password (replace the "XX" in the username with the number you were [assigned in class](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kBlYowhjjHJC9ZovmbBULmbqozKpprM17vZ2wPlhNg0/edit?usp=sharing)). 
> 2. Once you are on the login node, use `srun --pty -p interactive -t 0-2:30 --mem 1G /bin/bash` to get on a compute node.
> 3. Proceed once your command prompt has the word `compute` in it.
> 4. If you log out between lessons (using the `exit` command twice), please follow points 1. and 2. above to log back in and get on a compute node when you restart with the self learning.

II. **Complete the exercises**:
   * Each lesson above contains exercises; please go through each of them.
   * **Submit your solutions** into the [Google Form]() the **day before the next class**.
